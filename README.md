# LateX-Master
Here is all you need to write with LateX!

## Basic Knowledge about LaTeX
- **TeX** TeX is a typesetting language developed by Donald E. Kunth, today's worldwide de facto standard for high quality typesetting, designed to produce a large range of documents typeset to extremely high-quality standards.  Whereas, LateX is a Tex based typesetting system and collection of macros for document compilation and publication - not a word processor.

- **MiKTex** MiKTeX is a compiler and an  Windows O/S based TeX/LaTeX distributions, (i.e., a collection of TeX macros, LaTeX language structure hooked to LaTeX2e, (and  LaTeX3 under development) and basic document structure/components supports like BibTex, document classes, packages, etc.)  Other LaTeX distribution include MacTeX for Mac OS and Texlive for Linux and Unix. TexStudio is a GUI TeX editor dependent (not a standalone) on MikTeX Console and Mark-up language.

- **Tex Engines and Compilers** These are the executable binaries which implement different TeX variants. And, examples include pdfTeX, XeTeX, LuaTeX, etc.
For instance, pdfTeX implements direct PDF and tagged PDF output, along with a variety of programming and other extensions.
XeTeX does the above, and also supports Unicode natively, OpenType and TrueType fonts and, access to system fonts,etc.
**LuaTeX** does all the above, and provides access to many internals via the embedded Lua language, thus by far the most programmable engine.

- **TeXstudio: LATEX make easy and comfortable** TeXstudio is an integrated writing environment for creating LaTeX documents. The goal is to make writing LaTeX as easy and comfortable as possible, hence the highly technical, intuitively resourceful and numerous features like syntax-highlighting, integrated viewer, reference checking, tutorial playing, and various assistants.

  It has built-in support for various LaTeX compilers, index, bibliography and glossary tools, Latexmk, pdflatex, and many more. The other features and benefits include: 
  1. Automatic detection of the need for multiple LaTeX runs and dependency for a package, consequently download the package.
  2. It also has Advanced syntax highlighting, and Intelligent interface: these enables Interactive spellchecking, live interactive grammar checker and reference checker. Also, clear display of LaTeX errors and warnings (in the editor and as a list).
  3. You can generate blocks of code using assistants without the need for detailed LaTeX knowledge. A UI menu which allows you choose form for table, graphics and mathematics terms and ooerators. columns with a single click. The table-autoformatter helps you align the chosen table code.
  4. You can run any program you like including completely customized creation for desired complete document(style and type).
  5. You can use the integrated PDF viewer with (almost) word-level syncing, live-updating inline preview for formulas and code segments to preview your project or latex document.
  6. It has a Tooltip preview for included images which are inserted in \includegraphic command structure.
